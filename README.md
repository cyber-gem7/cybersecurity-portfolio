# About Me

**Name:** Amirah Husbands

**Hometown:** New York City by way of Waterbury, CT/USA

**Prior IT Experience:** I hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and previously worked as a software engineer and data analyst for financial firms.

**Career Plans:** After completing this cybersecurity course I hope to work in the defense industry as a network engineer.

**Proud Project:** A project that stands out from my time in school was when I had the opportunity to build a mobile video wall. Working alongside Dr. Jerry Volcy I constructed a modular screen using repurposed PC monitors, plywood, and Raspberry Pi. I then configured and troubleshoot the wireless network. The display was designed using Processing and the client-server architecture was coded in Python. This project was special to me because after I presented it at Research Day other students then made use of it in the Innovation Lab and around campus.
